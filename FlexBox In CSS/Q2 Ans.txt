Q2) Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout Model
   1.justify-content
   2.align-items
   3.gap
   4.flex-direction
   5.flex-wrap

Answer : 

(1) justify-content : 
                     The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and a
                     round content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a
                     grid container.

(2)align-items   : 
                    The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or 
                    grid container.

(3)gap           : 
                  The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in 
                  flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties:

(4)flex-direction :
                   The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.
                   Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect. 

(5)flex-wrap     : 
                  The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
                  Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect.
